Things that still need doing:

Win32:
        MSI Packaging Plugin: http://docs.python.org/library/msilib.html
        Registry scanning on Windows
        Installer creation on Windows

FS events system - don't bother, it cant be guaranteed in any case
    for linux: http://pyinotify.sourceforge.net/

Fix size of UI on startup.
Save position of wizard when it changes

List the drives available for scanning (might be more a Win32 thing perhaps?)

Exporter Plugins:
        Mac Installer PKG (done)
        MSI Installer (not started)
        Fileset Creator (simply create a new fileset - exported to disk)
        Fileset Merger (as above, but then choose an existing fileset to merge it into)
 
Unit Tests
==========

in the future I want to mock out the calls to the registry as well, both a simply (haha, simple, yeah, right) hierarchical systems of key/values.
