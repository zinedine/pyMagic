3rdparty Dependancies
=====================

This doc describes how to build and install the following:

Qt 4.7.x (you'll want to compile this yourself, ensuring its i386 arch)
SIP
PyQt

Python
======

To rebuild the python installation.
        run the install_python.sh
script, it'll build python into the 3rdparty directory using the right arch options.

SIP
===

First; uncompress the SIP code.

Run the install_sip.sh script, it'll build SIP using the Python you just build in the step above.

If you want to test that sip worked (remember to use the right python version):
    python
    $ import sip
    $

if you get errors, SIP installation failed.

PyQt (it relies on the above two)
=================================

First, uncompress the PyQt code - then run the install_pyqt.sh script file.

If you want to test that PyQt is working properly:
    python
    from PyQt4.Qt import *
    a = QApplication([])

if you get errors, PyQt installation failed.
