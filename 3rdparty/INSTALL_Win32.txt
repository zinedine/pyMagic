3rdparty Dependancies for Win32
===============================

This doc describes how to build and install the following:

SIP
PyQt

Python
======

Grab the standard 32 build of Python build from somewhere.  I'll assume its installed here:
	C:\Python27

Notice: 32 bit, even if you are running on a 64 bit OS - because the SIP and PyQt builds will build X86 code. 


Qt 4.7.3
========

Just grab a 4.7.x release of Qt from the Nokia website and install it.  I'll assume the path you install to is something like:
	C:\Qt\4.7.3
	
for the rest of this document.

Environment
===========

Make sure the following things are on your path:
- qmake 
- visual studio

To do this, run a script something like this:
set PATH=c:\Python27;%PATH%
set PATH=C:\Qt\4.7.3\bin;%PATH%
call c:\vs9\vc\bin\vcvars32.bat

SIP
===

First; uncompress the SIP code that you got as a ZIP file.

Then do this:
	cd sip-4.13
	python configure.py
	nmake
	nmake install

To test it worked:
	python
	>>> import sip
	>>>
	
If you get ZERO errors, it worked OK.
	
PyQt (it relies on the above two)
=================================

First, uncompress the PyQt code - then run then do this:
	cd PyQt-win-gpl-4.8.6
	python configure.py
	nmake
	nmake install

If you want to test that PyQt is working properly:
    python
    from PyQt4.Qt import *
    a = QApplication([])

if you get errors, PyQt installation failed.

Now you are in theory, good to go.
